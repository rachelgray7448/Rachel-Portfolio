            <p>
                Hello! My name is Rachel Gray and I am a Web Developer originally from Flint, MI, currently residing in the Lansing area with my fiance and my 3 fur children. I graduated from the University of Michigan-Flint in 2015 with a major in Psychology, and a minor in Linguistics. I then moved to Grand Rapids, MI and attended Grand Valley State University for my Master's in Speech-Language Pathology. I worked for several years as a Medical Speech-Language Pathologist in Skilled Nursing Facilities, but never felt fulfilled in the work I was doing. Eventually, I decided I need a change of pace and became very interested in development and coding, trialing short online programs in my free time. I'm currently enrolled in Michigan State University's Web Development Bootcamp and am excited at all the possibilites the future has to hold!
